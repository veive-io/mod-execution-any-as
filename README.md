# **Mod Execution Any**

## **Overview**

`ModExecutionAny` is a versatile execution module within the Veive protocol, tailored for the Koinos blockchain. This module's primary function is to execute any specified operation, providing a generic yet powerful tool for developers and users to perform a wide range of actions within the Veive ecosystem. By leveraging `ModExecutionAny`, users can seamlessly interact with smart contracts and other blockchain components without needing to create custom execution logic for each operation.

## **Purpose**

The `ModExecutionAny` module serves as a universal executor for operations, supporting a broad array of activities, from simple token transfers to complex smart contract interactions. Its primary features include:

- **Generic Execution Capability**: Unlike specialized execution modules designed for specific tasks, `ModExecutionAny` can execute any operation passed to it. This makes it an ideal choice for scenarios where a wide range of actions need to be supported without implementing custom logic for each.

- **Flexible Operation Handling**: The module accepts operations defined by `contract_id`, `entry_point`, and `args`, executing them as specified. This allows for dynamic interaction with various smart contracts and operations, making it a highly adaptable component within the Veive protocol.

- **Scope Management**: The default scope for `ModExecutionAny` is "any," meaning it is applicable to all operations unless otherwise specified. This broad applicability ensures that `ModExecutionAny` can serve as a fallback executor for any operation that does not match more specific execution modules.

## **Scope**

The default scope for `ModExecutionAny` is set to "any," allowing it to execute any operation without specific restrictions. This makes the module particularly useful as a general-purpose executor, providing a fallback mechanism when more specialized execution modules are not applicable.

## **Usage**

### **Installation**

To install the `ModExecutionAny` module, ensure you have the Veive protocol set up on your Koinos blockchain environment. Install the module using yarn:

```bash
yarn add @veive-io/mod-execution-any-as
```

Deploy the module contract on the Koinos blockchain and install it on the desired account using the `install_module` method provided by the Veive account interface. During installation, the `on_install` method is called to set the necessary configurations and link the module to the account.

### **Scripts**

```bash
yarn build
```

#### Dist
